A Blog Out Of Boostrap
======================

A simple blog that uses the blog engine bootstrap-blog


What's this? 
-------------
This is a simple blog that was built out of a pre-existing blog engine written by [Dan Silver] (https://github.com/dan-silver)
I learnt a lot about writing blog engines from this one. Feel free to check out the [main repo] (https://github.com/dan-silver/Node.js-Blog-Engine)
for more info on using the engine.

How to install? 
---------------
<pre><code> $ npm install bootstrap-blog</pre></code>

How to run it? 
---------------
You need to copy the Resources directory from the [main source](https://github.com/dan-silver/Node.js-Blog-Engine) or
feel free to clone from my fork. 
When you run the link for the first time an empty Views folder will be generated. You can either write your own views or 
copy them from the Views directory of the source.

TODO
-----
+   Add video blogging facility using WebRTC.
+   Add the ability to use tags to categorize content.
+   Provide FB login for admin and post directly to facebook.
